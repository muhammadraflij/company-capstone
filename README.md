<h2>AQIMonitor - an Air Quality Index Monitoring Platform</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify">AQIMonitor is an application to forecast the level of air quality in Indonesia. This application was created based on the continued increase in air pollution in Indonesia, until 2021 according to IQAir World Air Quality Indonesia ranks 17th highest air pollution in the world. This results in the emergence of potential climate damage, global warming, and ends in disaster. This application features air quality forecast information, articles, and notifications when air quality exceeds the safe limit, it is hoped that in the future it can invite public awareness of what is happening now, and can also be useful for the government to make policies related to air pollution. With this project, we hope to contribute to reducing the level of air pollution in Indonesia in accordance with the goal of SDGs no. 11 and 13. </div>

## 2. Machine Learning (ML)
<ul>
  <li>Find public datasets from weatherbit.io for Air Quality datasets: aqi, pm10, pm2.5, so2, o3, no2, co and for Weather datasets : rh, wind speed, temperature as shown in the file Dataset in this repo</li>
  <li>Make model for air quality and weather forecasting using LSTM models</li>
  <li>Ensure the air quality (aqi) forecasting output is in accordance with ISPU calculations</li>
  <li>Save and export the existing model to .h5 file format</li>
  <li>Deploy the existing model using Flask</li>
</ul>
